# Policy-Iteration-Algorithm-in-Python-with-Tests-on-Frozen-Lake-OpenAI-Gym-Environment

These code files implement the policy iteration algorithm in Python. To test the implementation, we use the Frozen Lake OpenAI Gym environment.

The tutorial webpage accompanying these code files is given here: https://aleksandarhaber.com/policy-iteration-algorithm-in-python-and-tests-with-frozen-lake-openai-gym-environment-reinforcement-learning-tutorial/

Explanation of the files: 

"policyIteration.py" - this is the main file that import the functions from "functions.py".

"functions.py" - this file implements two functions. The first function is the function used to evaluate the policy. The second function is used to improve the policy. These two functions are called from "policyIteration.py".
